## Software development is not only about technical skills, it is about mindset.

These are my top 5 principles that I use when developing. I call them guiding principles and found them very useful during my career.

Of course, there are more and maybe you have yours‚Ä¶

For me, these are crucial and yet simple, but very powerful:

## Top 5 Guiding Development Principles:

- **Always strive and maintain the DRY principle ‚Äî do not repeat yourself;**
- **Do not use hacks;**
- **Do not tolerate inconsistency;**
- **Be critical of every decision and requirement;**
- **Write decoupled code.**

It‚Äôs not only about theory here, I found that when a project gets away from these principles, problems happen, despite the best technologies used and the best intentions from team members.

Each of them is very self-explanatory. So I‚Äôll leave the interpretations to you üôÇ

Thank you for reading ‚ù§Ô∏è
