In this article, I’ll share with you how to use VSCode and XDebug to start debugging your Drupal project.

![Debug with Xdebug, VSCode and Lando](/images/blog/debug-with-xdebug-vscode-and-lando.webp)

This explanation assumes you are using Lando for local development and you have XDebug installed inside the Lando container.

For more information about Lando please check:

- [Lando website](https://lando.dev/)
- [Setup XDebug in Lando](https://docs.lando.dev/platformsh/caveats.html#xdebug)

## VSCode setup

First, you need to create a `launch.json` file in your workspace with the following code:

```json
{
  // Use IntelliSense to learn about possible attributes.
  // Hover to view descriptions of existing attributes.
  // For more information, visit: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=830387
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Listen for Xdebug",
      "type": "php",
      "request": "launch",
      "port": 9003,
      "pathMappings": {
        "/app/": "${workspaceFolder}/"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The path to the launch.json should be: `[PROJECT_ROOT]/.vscode/launch.json`

Then install the XDebug helper extension for Chrome: [Xdebug helper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/xdebug-helper/eadndfjplgieldjbigjakmdgkmoaaaoc)

## How to use the VSCode debugger

First, you need to start a debug session by clicking on the debug menu button:


![Start XDebug](/images/blog/start-xdebug.webp)


When you are in the debug tab in VSCode, in the drop-down, where the play button is, make sure you select **listen for Xdebug**:

![Select Listen for Xdebug](/images/blog/select-listen-for-xdebug.webp)

Or by selecting **Run → Start debugging** in the top menu:

Make sure XDebug is running in Lando by running: `lando xdebug-on` in the terminal.

Put a breakpoint where you want your code to break execution:

Open your local site in Chrome browser and select the XDebug extension:

Refresh the page and VSCode should break on the breakpoint and you can inspect variables, go back and forth in the code…

## Debug twig templates

Enable the devel module if you haven’t and simply put a

```{{ devel_breakpoint() }}```

 in the template you want to debug. You will have to go through a few steps to reach the template with the breakpoint, but nothing major.

Here is the Drupal documentation about it: [Debugging Twig templates](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/theming-drupal/twig-in-drupal/debugging-twig-templates).

This was it! Thanks a lot for reading ❤️
