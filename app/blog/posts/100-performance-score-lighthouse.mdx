## Introduction

The 100% score was not an _IdÃ©e fixe_, but it just happened. We just wanted the website to be fast and followed best practices.

Well, sometimes it is 99, but this is on mobile: ðŸ™‚

Here is the whole homepage (all measurements are done on the homepage), so you can get an idea of how the website looks:

One might say: _But your page size is very small!_ Yes, size always matters! ðŸ™‚

This is one of the keys to a fast website, but not the only one. You can still have a small page size but a very slow website. For example, imagesâ€”if you do not load them properly, you're done! No good Google Lighthouse score, bad performance overall, and a very, very angry client!

One might say: _But it looks like youâ€™re serving static HTML files._ Yes, that is true, but who isnâ€™t? Even Next.js, the most popular React meta-framework for full-stack apps, does it.

Yes, the page size is really small. But beyond that, letâ€™s look at the technologies and techniques used.

## ðŸ’¡ Tip #1: Keep Your Page Size Small

You will notice that the site is very simple: header and footer, six paragraphs on the homepageâ€”nothing fancy. HTML, CSS, and JS are kept as small and simple as possible.

## ðŸ’¡ Tip #2: Keep It Simple and Follow Best Practices

### Static HTML Generation

We use the **Drupal Tome** module for static site generation.

Static HTML is fast and secure. Since there are no server-side rendering operations, response times are extremely fast. This is the first key step for great results.

The HTML is pre-generated by Tome, then served and cached from a **CDN**, making it even faster. If youâ€™re not using static HTML generation, you must use something like **Varnish** to cache your pages, but thatâ€™s another topic. This is the simplest approach.

### Drupal Stack

We use only a few modules aside from core ones, keeping the site simple:

- **Tome** for static site generation
- **Responsive Image** (core)
- **Single Directory Components** (core experimental)
- **Paragraphs** for content building
- **Nomarkup module** for stripping unneeded Drupal HTML

## Images

We use the **Drupal Responsive Image** module to properly size images for different resolutions.

Key points for image optimization:

- **Lazy-load images** (except those above the fold) using `loading="lazy"`.
- **For above-the-fold images**, set `loading="eager"`, as lazy-loading them negatively affects performance scores.
- **Use modern image formats** like **WebP** or **AVIF** (better compression than PNG/JPEG).
- **Specify width and height** for images to improve rendering and prevent layout shifts.

### ðŸ’¡ Tip #3: Lazy Load Images Only Below the Fold

This helps improve the **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)** metric.

### CSS, JS, and Static Assets

- Enable **Drupal CSS and JS aggregation**.
- Use **Drupal Asset Libraries** to load only necessary CSS/JS per component.
- **Tailwind CSS** is used for stylingâ€”small CSS size, reusable classes, no specificity issues.
- **JavaScript:** Vanilla JS is used (no jQuery for better performance).
- **Fonts:** Downloaded locally, with `font-display: swap;` to prevent FOIT (Flash of Invisible Text).

If using Google Fonts, split files by Unicode range for smaller downloads.

### ðŸ’¡ Tip #4: Use Drupal Asset Libraries to Eliminate Unused CSS and JS

## Twig and Component-Based Approach

We use the **Single Directory Components (SDC)** module, which allows component-based theming in Drupal.

- Helps maintain **clean, consistent markup**.
- Reduces unnecessary CSS and JS.
- Works well with **Tailwind CSS** for streamlined styling.
- Paired with the **Nomarkup module** to remove unwanted Drupal markup.

### ðŸ’¡ Tip #5: Keep Your Markup Clean, Small, and Consistent

## General Tips and Tricks

âœ… Keep development and content as simple as possible.

âœ… Minimize page size (reduce payload sent to the browser).

âœ… Use **static HTML** and **CDN caching** for static assets (CSS, JS, fonts, icons).

âœ… **Lazy-load images**, but _not_ those above the fold.

âœ… Use **WebP** or **AVIF** for image compression.

âœ… Properly **resize images** and use responsive image techniques.

âœ… Write **modular CSS and JS** to avoid unused files.

âœ… **Aggregate, minify, and uglify** CSS and JS.
